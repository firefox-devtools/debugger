# debugger.html

[![slack-badge]][slack] ![][ci-status] [![npm-version]][npm-package] [![PRs Welcome]][make-a-pull-request]

debugger.html is a hackable debugger for modern times, built from the ground up using [React] and [Redux].  It is designed to be approachable, yet powerful.  And it is engineered to be predictable, understandable, and testable.

[Mozilla] created this debugger for use in the [Firefox] Developer Tools.  And we've purposely created this project in GitHub, using modern toolchains.  We hope to not only to create a great debugger that works with the [Firefox][firefox-rdp] and [Chrome][chrome-rdp] debugging protocols but develop a broader community that wants to create great tools for the web.
