## Getting Setup

![][debugger-intro-gif]

### Step 1. Install Yarn

```bash
npm i -g yarn@0.16.1
```
*Why Yarn and not NPM?*
NPM installs the latest versions. We use [Yarn][yarn] because we want to make sure everyone is using the same libraries.

*Why Yarn 0.16.1?*
Yarn is a new tool and it occasionally breaks.

### Step 2. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone git@github.com:devtools-html/debugger.html.git
cd debugger.html
yarn install
```

*What should I do if I get an error?*
Yarn is still new, please comment on this [issue][yarn-issue] if you see anything weird.

### Step 3. Open Firefox

In this step, we'll open Firefox. [Chrome](#starting-chrome) and [Node](#starting-node) are also available in the Appendix. It's not required, but it's generally nice to close other browsers first.

```bash
yarn run firefox
```

After Firefox is open, go to a page you want to debug. I recommend, TodoMVC http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/.

*Why am I opening Firefox from the terminal?*
The firefox command opens firefox with special permissions that enable remote debugging.

*What should I see?*
Here's a [screenshot][done-screenshot]

*What should I do if this doesn't work?*
You can either try to run it [manually](#starting-firefox) or comment on the [issue](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/1341).

### Step 4. Start the Debugger

Now that Firefox is open, lets start the [development server][dev-server]. In a new terminal tab, run these commands:

```bash
cd debugger.html
yarn start
```

*What does this do?*
This command starts a [development server][dev-server].

### Step 5. Open the Debugger

Go to `localhost:8000` in any browser to view the Debugger. If everything worked successfully, you should see this [screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/254562/20439428/7498808a-ad89-11e6-895d-d6db320c5009.png)

### Next Steps

Try this [first activity][first-activity] if you want to start debugging the debugger!

## Appendix

### Quick Setup

This setup is for people on the DevTools team and DevTools wizards.

```bash
npm i -g yarn@0.16.1
git clone git@github.com:devtools-html/debugger.html.git
cd debugger.html
yarn install

# close firefox if it's already running
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --start-debugger-server 6080 -P development

# create a new terminal tab
cd debugger.html
yarn start
```

### Starting Firefox

If you're looking for an alternative to `yarn run firefox`, you have two options: cli, gcli.

**Firefox CLI**

1. Run `firefox-bin` from the command line
```bash
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --start-debugger-server 6080 -P development
```

You'll be shown a prompt to create a new "development" profile. The development profile is where your remote development user settings will be kept. *It's a good thing :)*

1. Go to `about:config` and set these configs

Navigate to `about:config` and accept any warning message. Then search for the following preferences and double click them to toggle their values to the following. [example](http://g.recordit.co/3VsHIooZ9q.gif)

* `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` to `true`
* `devtools.chrome.enabled` to `true`
* `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` to `false`

1. Restart Firefox

Close firefox and re-open it with the `firefox-bin` command.

**Firefox GCLI**

* open Firefox
* *shift-F2* Open GCLI
* *listen 6080* - start listening on 6080

NOTE: this assumes that you've set the other appropriate `about:configs`

### Starting Chrome

There are two ways to run chrome. Here's the easy way to run chrome

```bash
yarn run chrome
```

Here's the slightly harder way.

```bash
 /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --no-first-run --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-dev-profile
```

Note that the [script](../bin/chrome-driver) just automates the command :)

### Starting Node

It's easy to start Node in a mode where DevTools will find it:

* *--inspect* - tells node to open a debugger server
* *--inspect=9223* - tells node to open a debugger server on 9223 instead of 9229.
* *--debug-brk* - tells node to pause on the first statement

```bash
node --inspect --debug-brk ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

**Note** *./node_modules/.bin/webpack* could be anything. We're often debugging webpack these days so it's often appropriate :/

**Note:** Currently Node.js debugging is limited in some ways, there isn't support for seeing variables or the console, but you can manage breakpoints and navigate code execution (pause, step-in, step-over, etc.) in the debugger across various sources.

### Windows + Linux setup

Windows and Linux should *just work*, but unfortunately there are several edge cases.

If you find any issues on these two platforms comment on these issues:
* [windows][windows-issue]
* [linux][linux-issue]

**Firefox windows command**
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe -start-debugger-server 6080 -P development
```
