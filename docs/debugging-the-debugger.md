# Debugging the Debugger

Debugging the Debugger is one of the highest levels of inception. Before you begin, prepare yourself for a mind-bending trip of self discovery.

### Playing with the debugger

Setup the Debugger so that your environment looks like this [gif][debugger-intro-gif].

If you have any questions, go back to the [getting setup][getting-setup] instructions.


### Design a new theme :snowflake:

Lets design a new theme for the debugger, it's not too hard! Our goal here is to style the source tree, editor, and other UI components.

Share your a screenshot of your theme [here](./getting-setup.md) ! Here's an example camo [theme][camo-theme] that I designed the other day.


### Make breakpoints dance :dancers:

Adding a breakpoint is a critical piece in the inception game...
Lets make the debugger do something special when a breakpoint is added.

```diff
diff --git a/src/components/Editor/Breakpoint.js b/src/components/Editor/Breakpoint.js
index e1f1afd1..4ab9ef59 100644
--- a/src/components/Editor/Breakpoint.js
+++ b/src/components/Editor/Breakpoint.js
@@ -38,6 +38,8 @@ class Breakpoint extends Component {
   addBreakpoint() {
     const { breakpoint, editor, selectedSource } = this.props;

+    // => hamster dance
+
     // Hidden Breakpoints are never rendered on the client
     if (breakpoint.hidden) {
       return;
```

We currently don't have anything awesome as a demo. If you come up with something cool, feel free to share it  [here][getting-started-issue] and we can add it to the doc!

### Pausing FTW :red_circle:

When the debugger pauses, the fun begins. Here's a [gif](http://g.recordit.co/qutDioRQvy.gif) of what the debugger does normally when it pauses. Your mission if you choose to accept it, is to make it do something truly weird.

Here's a patch to get you started; `WhyPaused.js` renders the pause reason into the sidebar, and `utils/pause.js` is used in several places to expose the current paused state.

```diff
diff --git a/src/components/SecondaryPanes/Frames/WhyPaused.js b/src/components/SecondaryPanes/Frames/WhyPaused.js

   if (!reasons[reasonType]) {
     console.log("Please file an issue: reasonType=", reasonType);
```

### Debugger Philosophy

Here's the debugger philosophy in a nutshell.

1. When you inspect the running debugger app, you're debugging a web app
2. The Debugger like other applications has an API to communicate with the browser
3. There's no magic here. If you can build a web app, you can hack on the debugger!
4. You are the debugger's principal customer. Remember, the customer is always right!

Please let us know if we're missing something zen  [here][getting-started-issue].


### Next Steps

Now that you've internalized the debugger philosophy, it's time to start putting this wisdom to use.

**Share what you know** Give a talk in school, work, or a local meetup. I'm willing to bet your audience will not know the debugger is a web app! Write a blog post. We'd be happy to link to it here and it could go a really long way towards helping a newcomer grok the philosophy.

- here are @amitzur's [slides][amit-slides] from his [talk][amit-tweet]

**Contribute back** take a look at how you can start [contributing][contributing]. We would love the help!
