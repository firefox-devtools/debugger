## Getting Started with Firefox Nightly

Running Firefox is similar to running [Mochitests](./mochitests.md) (our integration tests)

**Requirements**

* mercurial ( `brew install mercurial` )
* autoconf213 ( `brew install autoconf@2.13 && brew unlink autoconf` )

**Get Firefox**

`./bin/prepare-mochitests-dev`

On the first run, this will download a local copy of Firefox and set up an [artifact build](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Artifact_builds) (just think of a super fast Firefox build). It may take a while (10-15 minutes) to download and build Firefox.

There are two commands that you will need. `./firefox/mach build` and `./firefox/mach run` these can be run together
each time things change with `./firefox/mach build && ./firefox/mach run`

If you update your Firefox build infrequently, you may need to [Clobber the
tree](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Clobbering_the_Tree)

* The first time you run the project you will need to use `./mach build` but after the first run you can use `./mach build faster`! The full command looks like this`./mach build faster && ./mach run` (for more info about this take a look at the [mach docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/mach)

You should now have a fresh copy of nightly open up! You can pass a few properties to it as well,
such as -P <custom-profile> if you want to use a specific profile

### For Windows Developers

The detailed instructions for setting up your environment to build Firefox for Windows can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Windows_Prerequisites). You need to install the latest `MozBuild` package. You can open a unix-flavor shell by starting:

```
C:\mozilla-build\start-shell.bat
```

In the shell, navigate to the debugger.html project folder, and follow the Getting Started instructions as mentioned.

## Running Nightly with the local debugger

Now we can put these pieces together.

in debugger project (`projects/debugger.html` or wherever you have it!):

```
node ./bin/copy --mc <path to firefox>
```

in firefox project (`projects/firefox` or wherever you have it!):

```
./mach build faster && ./mach run
```

## Watching for Changes

If you would like to quickly make changes in github and update the files in MC automatically,
you can run `copy` with the `--watch` option.

```
node ./bin/copy --watch --mc <path to firefox>
```

Now you can make code changes the bundle will be automatically built for you inside `firefox`.

## Browser Toolbox

The browser toolbox is a new toolbox for debugging the browser! We use it all the time to debug the debugger when it is running in the panel. By the way, the other name for the panel is the content toolbox!

Here are some [docs][bt] on how to setup the browser toolbox.
