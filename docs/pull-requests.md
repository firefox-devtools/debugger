#### Screenshots

Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.

**Recording GIFs** There are many great tools for recording a GIF. On a mac, we recommend [recordit](http://recordit.co/), which is a free lightweight app.

**Tables**: When there are multiple screenshots, such as a style change that affects different themes or rtl, it can be nice to use a table for the screenshots [docs][github-tables]

If you're working on style change to the close button you could say:

- [x] Works in autocomplete

#### Testing

We use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to check the PR before it is pushed.

Here are docs on [tests][test-docs] and [linting][linting-docs], which you can run locally.


The integration tests will be run automatically by the CI. Our integration tests are run with [mochitest][mochitest]. The local setup process is documented [here][mochitest-docs], but the process is a bit cumbersome, so reviewers will generally help debug.

#### Reviews

Once the tests have passed in the PR you must receive a review using the GitHub review system

We have a number of contributors reviewing PRs fairly quickly, if you feel yours has been neglected please mention the team name **@devtools-html/debugger** in the PR

#### Updates

We value landing PRs smoothly. One way we minimize back and forth, is by pushing updates directly to PR branches.

There are a couple times when we do this:
* it's a small syntax or style change that's blocking a merge
* we want to suggest a refactor. At this point, feel free to offer your opinion.
