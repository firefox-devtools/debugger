## Debugger Screencasts

**Goals:**

* Help newcomers get started
* Give a visual flavor of how the Debugger works
* Show how some of the React + Redux concepts come together to create the Debugger
* Introduce you to the team. The Debugger is a fun project and we don't take ourselves too seriously!

### Getting Started
This [video](https://youtu.be/9bQ0a3pnBZk) walks through the [getting setup][getting-setup] steps:

1. starting the [dev server][dev-server]
2. starting chrome and firefox
3. launching the debugger
4. and then jumps in to [debugger inception][first-activity] because it's too cool not to!

###  Event Listeners part 1

This [video](https://youtu.be/VOwn1U7K2qg) gives an overview of [event listeners][event-listeners], a new feature we're working on that lists the event handlers on the page. After that, we jump in and make each event listener link to where the handler is defined.

### Event Listeners part 2

This [video](https://youtu.be/NoMryxkNPk0) adds additional functionality to event listeners, such as a checkbox that enables and disables breakpoints for that listener and a close button that removes the breakpoint entirely. Along the way, fetch breakpoints, refactor the component, and squash lots of bugs as they emerge.
