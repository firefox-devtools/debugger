### Members on Break/Paused

From time to time, and for many reasons that life gives us, one of our community team members may need reduce or pause their involvement for a while. We might still see them in Slack, or commenting in bugs, but we have no expectations of regular availability.

### Firefox Debugger Community Team - Emeritus

Emeritus status honors those who have dedicated time and talent to the Debugger project, but for many reasons have needed to step back. We want to make sure they remain as a visible part of Debugger's history and success.

- If you think we've missed someone, please ping someone on the staff team
