### Members on Break/Paused

From time to time, and for many reasons that life gives us, one of our community team members may need to reduce or pause their involvement for a while. We might still see them in Slack, or commenting on bugs, but we have no expectations of regular availability.

### Firefox Debugger Community Team - Emeritus

Emeritus status honors those who have dedicated time and talent to the debugger project, but have needed to step back for any of a variety of reasons. While they may not be actively contributing here any longer, we want to make sure they remain a visible part of the Firefox Debugger's history and success.

- If you think we've missed anyone that should be included here, please contact someone on the staff team.

### Joining the Team

We welcome active contributors to join the _debugger_ team. Specifically, we are looking for contributors with:

* Passion for the Firefox Debugger project
* Interest in helping other contributors, and fostering community growth
* Two months of active contribution to the repository.

To apply, simply contact one of our staff or community team members via Slack or email, and we'll get right back to you.

We embrace diversity, and invite people from any and all backgrounds to get involved in the _debugger_ project. We don't discriminate based on family status, gender, gender-identity, marital status, sexual orientation, sex, age, ability, race and/or ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity.

### Review Periods

Once per year, we'll check in with our team members (both _active_ and _on break_) to ensure they are feeling supported, and to check if they will remain active on our team for the coming months. If we do not hear back from members at check-in time, they will be transitioned to an alumni role.

As of this writing, **the next review period will be during the month of July 2019**.
