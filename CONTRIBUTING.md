## What should I know before I get started?

The developer tools in most major browsers are just web applications.  They are HTML & JS rendered by the browser and talk to the browser itself through an API that gives access to the page internals.  This project is a brand new web application interface for JavaScript debugging designed for browsers and JS environments.

We strive for collaboration with [mutual respect for each other](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).   Mozilla also has a set of [participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) which goes into greater detail specific to Mozilla employees and contributors.

### debugger.html

The debugger.html project is a JavaScript debugger built from the ground up using modern web application technologies.  It is designed first for debugging Firefox but also for working with projects like Chrome and Node.  The name debugger.html was chosen because this debugger interface is being written using modern web technologies where as the previous Firefox debugger was written in [XUL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL).

### devtools.html

devtools.html is the larger umbrella initiative that encompasses the debugger.html and several other devtools projects.  The devtools.html project claims its origin from a demo for a Mozilla (Dec 2015) work week in Orlando, FL USA where the team worked under a tight deadline to provide a proof of concept of the Firefox developer tools running in pure HTML; even outside of Firefox. The code for that demo can be found on GitHub under [@joewalker/devtools.html](https://github.com/joewalker/devtools.html).

From that original demo the devtools.html project has progressed quite a bit.  To learn more about it please read the [devtools.html proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_5aerWTN_GVofr6YQVjmJlaGfZ4nv5YKZmdGHewfTpE/edit#heading=h.dw3amfbdp0lh) and take a look at the [devtools.html meta bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1263750) for tracking progress.

### Firefox Developer Tools

The debugger.html project is targeted to land in Firefox for Firefox 52.  However if you're looking to work directly on the DevTools project which ships developer tools for Firefox and Firefox Developer Edition right now you can find more information on the Mozilla wiki [DevTools / Get Involved](https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/GetInvolved).

## Getting Started

The debugger.html is a web application that makes a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) connection to a debuggable target like the JavaScript engine of a web browser.  The web application then interprets data and sends commands to the JS engine to manage the debugging environment; for example by creating a breakpoint or displaying that the JS engine is paused at a breakpoint.

### Web Application

First we need to get the web application running. Within the source code directory, from the command line run these commands.

### Linux or MacOs

* `npm i -g yarn@0.16.1` - Install Yarn
* `git clone git@github.com:devtools-html/debugger.html.git` - Clone Debugger
* `yarn install` - Install dependencies.
* `yarn start` - Start development web server

NOTE: :cat2: We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) so that we all have the same setup.

### Windows

It is recommended to use Git Shell which comes with [GitHub Desktop] application to emulate bash on Windows.

* `npm i -g yarn@0.16.1` - Install Yarn
* `git clone git@github.com:devtools-html/debugger.html.git` - Clone Debugger
* `yarn install` - Install dependencies
* `yarn start` - Start development web server

NOTE: :cat2: We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) so that we all have the same setup.

### Open the debugger

After `yarn start`, the debugger will be running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and you can open it in any browser. [screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/254562/20393011/44ca6a8a-aca8-11e6-99f7-05f21767ae6d.png)

### Debuggable Targets

The following are instructions for getting Firefox, Chrome, and Node running with remote debugging turned on.  Remote debugging is necessary for the debugger.html project to connect to these targets.

#### Firefox

The following command will automatically start a remote debuggable version of Firefox using a temporary profile and set all the necessary preferences for you. This command runs Firefox in a selenium environment that is great for quick testing.

```
$ yarn run firefox
```

When firefox is running, reload `localhost:8000` and you'll see the available firefox tabs to debug in the debugger. ![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/254562/20393075/7e494024-aca8-11e6-8578-19a6d73be6ed.png)

**Command line option**

Here are the instructions for running Firefox from the command line without selenium:

**MacOs**:

```
$ /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --start-debugger-server 6080 -P development
```

**Windows:**

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe -start-debugger-server 6080 -P development
```

> If this command doesn't work for your OS or Firefox version see the other [Firefox commands for running in a debuggable state](./docs/remotely-debuggable-browsers.md#firefox)

**NOTE**: The Firefox started from the `yarn run` command automatically sets the following necessary flags which you will need to do manually if you ran Firefox from the command line.

Navigate to `about:config` and accept any warning message. Then search for the following preferences and double click them to toggle their values to the following. [example](http://g.recordit.co/3VsHIooZ9q.gif)

* `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` to `true`
* `devtools.chrome.enabled` to `true`
* `devtools.debugger.prompt-connection` to `false`

Once you have Firefox running in a debuggable state go back up to instructions for restarting your development server.

#### Chrome

Start by running Chrome from the terminal with remote debugging turned on.

```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --no-first-run --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-dev-profile http://localhost:7999/todomvc/
```

* If this command doesn't work for your OS or Chrome version see the other [Chrome commands for running in a debuggable state](./docs/remotely-debuggable-browsers.md#chrome)
* NOTE: This command also creates a new _temporary_ profile


#### Node.js

Debugging node requires at least node v6.3.0 and running node with the `inspect` flag turned on.  Here's what running node looks like when running an example `server.js` file.

```
$ node --inspect server.js
```

With node running in _inspect mode_ go to your browser running `localhost:8000` and click **[connect to Node](http://localhost:8000/?ws=localhost:9229/node)**

**Note:** Currently Node.js debugging is limited in some ways, there isn't support for seeing variables or the console, but you can manage breakpoints and navigate code execution (pause, step-in, step-over, etc.) in the debugger across various sources.

## How Can I Contribute?

Here is a great GitHub guide on [contributing to Open Source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) to help you get started.

### Reporting Bugs :bug:

If you find an issue with the code please do [file an issue](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/new) and tag it with the label [bug](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/labels/bug).  We'll do our best to review the issue in a timely manner and respond.

### Suggesting Enhancements :new:

We are actively investigating ways of support enhancement requests in the project so these instructions are subject to change.  For now please create an issue, tag it with the [enhancement][labels-enhancement] label and we will attempt to respond.

### Writing Documentation :book:

Documentation is as important as code and we need your help to maintain clear and usable documentation.  If you find an error in here or other project documentation please [file an issue](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/issues/new) and tag it with the label [docs](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/labels/docs).

### Writing Code :computer:

We have a number of tools to help you with your code contributions, the following describes them all and how you can make use of them.

If you've contributed to an open source project before and would like to help this one please take a look through the `up for grabs` issues:

* [up for grabs][labels-up-for-grabs] - issues should have clear requirements and a difficulty level set as a label

If you find an `up for grabs` issue without a difficulty level set as a label or unclear requirements please comment in the issue so we can get that fixed.

#### Your First Code Contribution

If you're looking for a good issue, you can look through the `up-for-grabs` issues. These issues should be actionable and well documented.

There are several difficulty levels, *easy*, *medium*, *hard*. We recommend grabbing an *easy* issue, but it's up to you.

* [up-for-grabs][labels-up-for-grabs] - issues that are not assigned to anyone and are available to be worked on.
* [difficulty:easy][labels-difficulty-easy] - clear expectations and a mentor to help you through.
* [difficulty:medium][labels-difficulty-medium] - more complex and may not have as clear expectations.
* [difficulty:hard][labels-difficulty-hard] - complex and has some open technical questions.


To begin your work make sure you follow these steps:

* [Fork this project](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html#fork-destination-box)
* Create a branch to start your work `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
* Commit your work
* Create a [pull request](#pull-requests)

#### Coding Standards

> Be consistent with the rest of the code in the file

Here are pointers to the DevTools general coding style and formatting guidelines.

* [JS Coding Style](https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/CodingStandards#Code_style)
* [Formatting Comments](https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/CodingStandards#Comments)

#### Issues

We use issues and milestones for planning purposes as well as tracking bugs.

**Keep Issues Relevant**

We try to keep the number of open issues to a minimum.  If work isn't going to be done in a timely manner we would rather close the issue than let them go stale.  Closed issues can always be reopened again when we are ready to start the work.  This process helps keep the focus of the project more understandable to others.

**Intent to implement**

When a person is assigned to an issue this indicates an _intent to implement_.  Please ask within the issue if you would like to work on a fix so multiple people don't create pull requests for it.

#### Pull Requests

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* List any steps necessary to trigger the feature you've created or bug you are fixing
* Always run the [unit tests](#unit-tests) locally before creating your PR
 * The [integration tests](#integration-tests) will be run automatically by the CI or you can try running them locally as well
* Once the tests have passed in the PR you must receive a review using the GitHub review system
 * To learn more about GitHub reviews take a look at their [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/) and [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/HW0RPaJqm4g)
* Request review from @jasonLaster or @jlongster by mentioning their names in the PR

> **Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

#### Hot Reloading :fire:

Hot Reloading watches for changes in the React Components JS and CSS and propagates those changes up to the application without changing the state of the application.  You want this turned on.

To enabled Hot Reloading:

* [Create a local config file](#create-a-local-config-file) if you don't already have one
* Edit the `config/local.json` you just created to change the value of `hotReloading` to be `true`

```json
{
  "hotReloading": true
}
```

* Restart your development server by typing `ctrl+c` in the Terminal and run `yarn start` again

Read more about [Hot Reloading](./docs/local-development.md#hot-reloading)

### Logging

Logging information can be very useful when developing, and there are a few logging options available to you.

To enable logging:

* [Create a local config file](#create-a-local-config-file) if you don't already have one
* Edit your local config, changing the value of the logger type you want to see to `true`

```json
  "logging": {
    "client": false,
    "firefoxProxy": false,
    "actions": true
  }
```

Let's cover the logging types.

* client -  This option is currently unused.

* firefoxProxy - This logger outputs a verbose output of all the Firefox protocol packets to your shell.

* actions - This logger outputs the Redux actions fired to the browser console.

### Tests

Your code must pass all tests to be merged in.  Your tests should pass locally before you create a PR and the CI should run an automated test that also passes.

Here's how can run all the unit tests, lints, and integration tests at once:

```
$ yarn run test-all
```

#### Unit Tests

* `yarn test` - Run tests headlessly
 * These are the basic unit tests which must always pass
* `yarn run mocha-server` - Run tests in the browser once you open `http://localhost:8003`
 * This runs tests in the browser and is useful for fixing errors in the karma tests

#### Integration tests

We use [mochitests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Mochitest) to do integration testing.  Running these integration tests locally requires some finesse and so as a contributor we only ask that you run the unit tests.   The mochitests will be run by the automated testing which runs once you've made a pull request and the maintainers are happy to help you through any issues which arise from that.

Learn more about mochitests in our [mochitests docs](./docs/mochitests.md).

#### Linting

Run all of lint checks (JS + CSS) run the following command:

```
$ yarn run lint
```

##### Lint CSS

We use [Stylelint](http://stylelint.io/) to maintain our CSS styles.  The [.stylelintrc](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/.stylelintrc) file contains the style definitions, please adhere to those styles when making changes.

To test your CSS changes run the command:

```
$ yarn run lint-css
```

##### Lint JS

We use [eslint](http://eslint.org/) to maintain our JavaScript styles.  The [.eslintrc](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/.eslintrc) file contains our style definitions, please adhere to those styles when making changes.

To test your JS changes run the command:

```
$ yarn run lint-js
```

To automatically fix many errors run the command:

```
$ yarn run lint-fix
```

## Configuration

All default config values are in [`packages/devtools-config/configs/development.json`](./packages/devtools-config/configs/development.json), to override these values you need to [create a local config file](#create-a-local-config-file).

Here are the most common development configuration options:

* `logging`
  * `firefoxProxy` Enables logging the Firefox protocol in the terminal running `yarn start`
* `chrome`
  * `debug` Enables listening for remotely debuggable Chrome browsers
* `hotReloading` enables [Hot Reloading](./docs/local-development.md#hot-reloading) of CSS and React

For a list of all the configuration options see the [packages/devtools-config/README.md](./packages/devtools-config/README.md)

### Create a local config file

* Copy the [`configs/development.json`](./configs/development.json) to `configs/local.json`
